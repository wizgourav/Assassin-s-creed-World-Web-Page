            <h4>Altaïr Ibn-LaʼAhad (Arabic: الطائر ابن لا أحد, meaning "The Bird, Son of No One") is a fictional character in Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed video game series. He first appears as the main playable character of the original Assassin's Creed game, which takes place during the Third Crusade in 1191.</h4>
            <h5>His later appearances include the spin-offs Assassin's Creed: Altaïr's Chronicles and Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines, which also feature him as the protagonist, and the sequels Assassin's Creed II and Assassin's Creed: Revelations, in which he is playable only during certain sequences.The character has been generally well received, with praise for Altaïr's skills as an Assassin and personal growth. However, some have criticized his lack of backstory in the first game, as well as Philip Shahbaz's vocal performance. Alongside Ezio, he is typically considered the face of the franchise and one of its most popular characters, leading to several crossover appearances outside the Assassin's Creed series.</h5>
